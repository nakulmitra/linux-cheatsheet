# Switching Between Files in `vimdiff`
When we're using `vimdiff file1 file2`, both files open side-by-side. Here's how to switch and manage between them:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Ctrl + w h` | Move to the **left** split (file1) |
| `Ctrl + w l` | Move to the **right** split (file2) |
| `Ctrl + w w` | Toggle between splits |
