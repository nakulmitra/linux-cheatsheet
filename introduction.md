## Introduction to Linux

**Linux** is a powerful, open-source operating system that is widely used in servers, development environments, embedded systems, and even desktops. It was originally created by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991 and has since grown into a dominant OS used in data centers, mobile devices (Android), cloud platforms, and DevOps pipelines.

Linux is based on **Unix principles** and offers:

* A **multiuser**, **multitasking** environment
